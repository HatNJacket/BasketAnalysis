# TODO
- [ ] Read data from text or .csv, same function
- [ ] Do Apriori (Stop at maybe 2000? Takes 5 seconds in theory)
- [ ] Do PCY
- [ ] Build a graph
- [ ] Set up an html homepage with my dataset already uploaded
- [ ] Anything more is just a happy extra bit. Think about all this after the website is set up and displaying graphs.
